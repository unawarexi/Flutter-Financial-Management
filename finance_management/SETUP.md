# Cloning the Repository and Using FVM

This guide will walk you through the process of cloning a Git repository and using Flutter Version Management (FVM) to manage your Flutter versions. Follow these steps:

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- Ensure you have FVM installed. You can install it by running `dart pub global activate fvm`.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    - Run the following command to clone the repository:
      ```sh
      git clone <repository_url>
      ```
    - Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    - Change into the project directory by running:
      ```sh
      cd <project_directory>
      ```
    - Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of the directory created by the clone command.

3. **Install FVM:**
    - If you haven't installed FVM yet, you can do so by running:
      ```sh
      dart pub global activate fvm
      ```

4. **Use FVM to Install the Required Flutter Version:**
    - Check the `.fvm/fvm_config.json` file in the project directory to see the required Flutter version.
    - Run the following command to install the required Flutter version:
      ```sh
      fvm install
      ```

5. **Use the Installed Flutter Version:**
    - To use the installed Flutter version, run:
      ```sh
      fvm use
      ```

6. **Run Flutter Commands with FVM:**
    - You can now run Flutter commands using FVM. For example:
      ```sh
      fvm flutter pub get
      fvm flutter run
      ```

By following these steps, you will have successfully cloned the repository and set up the required Flutter version using FVM.
